# Weather-WebScraper-Visualisation-
A web scraper that fetches live weather data of London to visualize.

Initially planned to build a scraper web app that takes into account the strikes that has affected London's transport systems via .xlsx data from TfL. The ideas was to demonstrate how economic disparity influences the strikes since COVID 19 across a heatmap of London presented with a time slider. TfL has yet to send me in the data for it and the API doesn't hold such information publicly. 

This is a pivot to a basic weather data visualization app through an animated ball that moves in a clockwise ellipse. The ball's color and speed change dynamically based on real-time temperature data.

Features: 

Colour Gradient: The ball's color changes across a gradient from blue to red, representing temperature variation

Speed Variant: The speed of the ball increases as the temperature rises. 

Thanks and feel free to contribuite!
