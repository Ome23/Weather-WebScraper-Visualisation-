## Real-time Weather Data Visualization Project Documentation

### Steps Taken

1. **Initial Setup**
  - Created the initial HTML structure.
  - Centered the header text using CSS.

2. **Process Log**
  - Added a Process Log section in the HTML to document each step.

3. **Web Scraping Attempt**
  - Tried to scrape weather data from Google Search results using Python and BeautifulSoup.
  - Encountered an issue where the scraped data was not found.

### Issues Faced

1. **Web Scraping Failure**
  - Google's search results are dynamically generated and may require JavaScript to load, which the `requests` library can't handle.
  - Google has mechanisms to detect and block scraping attempts. 
  - Used user agent string

### Alternative Considered

1. **Weather API**
  - As an alternative to web scraping, using a weather API to fetch real-time weather data is understood.

### Next Steps

1. **Weather API Integration**
  - The next step is to use a weather API to gather the required data for the project.

2. **Successfully integrated Weather API and moved to Vis**

### Visualisation

1. **Created an animation of a ball that moves in a clockwise ellipse while changing color and speed according to temperature such that it changes from Blue to Red, with an increasing speed as it moves from Low to High Temperature**
